      <p>Murders are on the rise in New York City. In October of 2020 murder rates have already surpassed the <a
          href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/historical-crime-data/seven-major-felony-offenses-2000-2019.pdf"> total amount recorded in 2019. </a>
        There has been <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/09/15/at-least-321-murders-in-nyc-this-year---the-largest-increase-in-decades---nypd-stats-show"> speculation </a> around the city that these rates have risen due to the
        coronavirus pandemic.
      </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/brian-lawton"> Dr. Brian Lawton, </a> a criminology professor who specializes in Public Health at CUNY’s John Jay College for Criminology, stated that COVID-19 might have something to do with the
        rise in homicides. “The victim/offender relationship here is
        key,” Dr. Lawton specified. Further stating that without having access to each “individual murders we need to be a bit cautious about making any sweeping statements.”
      </p>

      <p> Dr. Lawton also stated that it is important to note that the city “has been at a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/historical-crime-data/seven-major-felony-offenses-2000-2019.pdf"> historic low
        </a> for homicide these past few years.” “We should always expect to see some fluctuation so a jump up may not be easily attributable to any one
        thing.”
